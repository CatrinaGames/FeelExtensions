## Feel Extensions
This repository contains community-created extensions for Feel, More Mountains' bestselling game feel solution, [available on the Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/2acD?aid=1011lKhG). These extensions can be anything, from an alternate take on an existing feedback, to brand new ones, or new ways to improve your game's juice.

## Why aren't these in Feel directly?
Because they weren't created by Renaud, the creator of Feel, and because Feel tries to remain simple to use. And just pouring features into it (as cool as they may be) wouldn't be such a great idea, and because Feel is meant to be extended upon, and these extensions are great examples of that.

## Do I need to pay something? Give credit?
No you don't, it's all free to use. Feel free to give credit to their creators though (they'll mention that in the class' comments if they want to).

## Are more extensions coming? Can I contribute?
Absolutely, contributions are always welcome. If you want to contribute, drop me a line using [the form on this page](https://feel.moremountains.com/feel-contact), or create a pull request on this very repository.

## Hey this extension is not working!
You'd need to contact the creator of the extension if they've put their contact info in the class somewhere. If not, not much I can do, I won't provide support for these.
