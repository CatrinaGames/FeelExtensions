# Cinemachine Extensions

Intended for feedbacks and shakers for Cinemachine


## Feedbacks

## Shakers

* `MMCinemachineVignetteShaker` _by AnEmortalKid_ : a vignette shaker that works with the `MMF_Vignette` feedback. 
  * Cinemachine does not require a Post Process volume for its post process effects, this shaker is almost a like for like copy of `MMVignetteShaker` 
    with some minor adjustments to work with a Cinemachine Virtual Camera.
